Hi, I am a web designer at [@github](https://github.com/github) making all sort of stuff but mostly websites. I was born and raised in France and move to the Bay Area in 2016. I'm not particulary nice or optimistic. If you really want to know more about me, consider reading [my footnotes](https://slrncl.com/)
