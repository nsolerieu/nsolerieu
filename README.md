Hi, I am a web designer at [@github](https://github.com/github) making all sort of stuff but mostly websites. I was born and raised in France and move to the Bay Area in 2016. I'm not particulary nice or optimistic, I'm obsessed with craft, walking, eggs. I have developed an aversion to all things entertaining so please don't tell me about your favorite TV show, your dog or the latest restaurant you've been to. A good quote to ponder on is always appreciated though.
