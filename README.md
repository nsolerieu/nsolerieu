Hi, I am @nsolerieu. I am a web designer at @GitHub and like designing all sort of stuff but mostly website. I was born and raised in France and move to the Bay Area in 2016. I'm not particulary nice or optimistic, I'm obsessed with craft and have developed an aversion to all things entaining - Excpect quote. I always appreciate a good quote to ponder on. I'm focused on craft (I'm not even that good), being intentional (I can barely meditate 15min) and philosophy (Plato would be appalled by what I call philosophy).

#### The work stuff
My design approach is realistic and creative, supported by skills in frontend development â€” all that to say that I know how to translate my ideas into HTML and CSS (except when they are too weird). My specialty is web design but have been enjoying creating all sorts of visuals for product like icons, illustrations and prototypes. You can see my most recent stuff on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/SLRNCL) or the few case studies I have up on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/SLRNCL).
