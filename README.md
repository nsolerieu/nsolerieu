Hi, I am [@nsolerieu](https://github.com/nsolerieu). I am a web designer at [@github](https://github.com/github) and like designing all sort of stuff but mostly websites. I was born and raised in 🇫🇷France and move to the 🌁 Bay Area in 2016. I'm not particulary nice or optimistic, I'm obsessed with craft and have developed an aversion to all things entaining - except quotes and food. I always appreciate a good quote to ponder on and some good bread.

#### The work stuff
My design approach is realistic and creative, supported by skills in frontend development — all that to say that I know how to translate my ideas into HTML and CSS (except when they are too weird). My specialty is web design but have been enjoying creating all sorts of visuals for product like icons, illustrations and prototypes.
